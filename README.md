# Recruitment task

### About
This task consists of two parts: the pop up and the email layout. In this project I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. JavaScript was used for the accessible floating labels in inputs. A name of the person submitting form is stored in localStorage in order to use it in the "thank you" page.
